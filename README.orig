browser.vim
===========

This plugin provides vim with basic web browsing capabilities. It includes 
support for history, bookmarks, text highlighting and more. The main 
motivation is browsing documentation available in html, so don't expect to 
see any flash animation :)

The plugin is implemented using perl's ability to embed perl, so you will 
need to have a perl enabled version of vim to use it. In addition, several 
perl modules are required. The full details are in the INSTALL file.

Documentation is available in pod form in 'browser.pod', and as a usual vim 
help file.

I wrote and tested it with vim version 6.3 and perl 5.8.4 on linux. I expect 
it to work on any variant of unix (and only there).

Please send me any feedback.

Enjoy!
